# (MERN) Book Search Engine
Module 21 Bootcamp Challenge

## Description
This application is a refactor of an already functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This is a MERN stack using a React front end and a MongoDB database.
